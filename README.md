## My Insights

### 🔁 Potential Improvements
- The excel file provided should have separated sheets for different tables which can help making the code more robust and reducing potential errors.
- Support for `.xlsx` and `.csv` formats.
- File upload endpoint for dynamic file processing.
- UI dashboard to visualize Excel data.

### ⚠️ Missed Edge Cases
- The Table names are recognized based on Italic font and borders for table, so multiple tables can be recognized in the same sheet, if you don't make the table-name italic it will be missed.
- As I am using a dictionary for storing tables duplicate names can cause issues.
- Empty Excel files or sheets.
- Non-numeric or malformed values in data rows.
